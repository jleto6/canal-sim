# Panama Canal System Simulation

A lightweight Unity simulation of the Panama Canal’s lock and lake system. It visually models ship movement, water flow, and elevation changes with simplified mechanics.

Developed in Unity with C#, this tool illustrates ship transit through locks, elevation shifts, and Gatun Lake’s role as a freshwater reservoir. It’s designed for conceptual understanding rather than physical-scale accuracy.

This simulation was developed as part of a DoD-sponsored project focused on freshwater sustainability in the Panama Canal. While related tools focused on engineering modeling and water usage calculations, this simulation was designed to support stakeholder communication by providing an intuitive, high-level view of canal function.

## Technologies
- Unity (C#)
- Custom scripting to simulate system behavior and transitions
